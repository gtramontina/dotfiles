## Setup <img src="https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/000000/keyboard.png" align="right" width="24">

```shell
curl -Ls https://git.io/vUxHe | bash
```

The above short URL resolves to the raw master version of the [`setup`](https://github.com/gtramontina/dotfiles/blob/master/setup) file. It is equivalent to:

```shell
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtramontina/dotfiles/master/setup | bash
```

## What? <img src="https://img.icons8.com/plasticine/100/000000/test-tube.png" align="right" width="24">

I use [`cider`](https://github.com/msanders/cider) to manage my dotfiles, brew formulas and casks, system settingsâ€¦ The above script will install [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh), Python (`brew install python`) and lastly `cider` itself. Once the requirements are met, it'll run `cider restore` and the setup process will take place.
